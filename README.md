# VBA-Challenge
Stock analysis challenge two

# Overview of Project
This project was developed to see this there was a more efficiant way to factor our origional code to run its stock analysis on an extremely large amount of data more efficiantly. the initial purpose of our code was to compare growth patters of various stocks in 2017 and 2018 to determine which would be the wisest to invest in. By creating buttons that showed us the amount of time it took to preform each analysis, we are able to have a clear understanding of the efficiancy of our code, and whether or not we could re-use it to run the same analysis on thousands of stocks.

# Results
Our first analysis of the stocks ran in the year 2017 ran in .859375 seconds. It also showed us that the only stock that didn't exhibit growth in that year was TERP (TerraForm Power)

The second analysis ran in 2018 was preformed in .9375 seconds. This showed that only two of the stocks in that year exhibited growth, EPNH (Enphase Energy Inc) and RUN (Sunrun Inc)

# Summary
Refactoring code can be extremely helpful when the amount or type of data begins to change. Instead of beginning from scratch you can follow the same logic within your code to more effectively preform similar tasks. However, it does require an extremely in depth understanding of the analysis you want to preform and the output youre looking to recieve, as refactoring poorly could ruin the origional code you began with in the first place.
